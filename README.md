# Hi, my name is Brian Kwon!

I graduated from the University of Rochester in 2022 with a B.A in Political Science with emphasis in Data Analytics and Comparative Politics. My studies in political science introduced me to how important data is and how much data is valued in areas such as election prediction and government stability. During my undergraduate years, I was involved in a research project where I utilized data analytics to help measure and predict democratic erosion in Thailand in the 21st century. After I graduated, I've became more interested in Data Science and so I completed the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate in order to expand both my technical skills in this field.
